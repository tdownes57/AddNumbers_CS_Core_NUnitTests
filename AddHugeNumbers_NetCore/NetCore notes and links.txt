The Big Difference

.NET Core and the .NET framework, for the most part, have a subset-superset relationship. 

.NET Core is called “core” because it contains all the core features of the .NET Framework- both the runtime 
and framework libraries. For e.g. they share the JIT, GC and types such as List and String.

The fundamental purpose of .NET Core was so that .NET could be open source, cross-platform and be used 
in more resource-constrained environments.
